h1. Installation via RubyGems

* Daily builds: @gem install rango --pre@ _(Daily builds currently doesn't work, I'm going to fix it till end of this week.)_
* Stable version: @gem install rango@

_We were using option @--development@ for installing development dependencies, unfortunately Rack has Mongrel as a development dependency and Mongrel compilation fails on Ruby 1.9, so I put everything into normal dependencies for now._
