h1. Generators

h2. Customizing Rango generators

Rango like to be simple and as such we don't need to generate much code. Rango itself has just three generators: *project generator*, *flash application generator* and *application generator*. The only thing they do is that they copy @lib/stubs/project@, resp. @lib/stubs/app@ to current directory. If you like to use your own stubs, just create @~/.rango/stubs@ with @project@ and/or @app@ directories and fill them with your files.

h2. Adding generators to your plugin

It's actually pretty easy. The plugin just need use this: @Rango::Generator.register(path/to/your/generators)@

pupu ale bude chtit trochu vic.

-> mit kontext a natvrdo gsubovat

context = {modname: ARGV.first.snake_case}
Rango::Generator.new(directory, context)

module {{ modname }}
  VERSION = "0.0.1"
end
